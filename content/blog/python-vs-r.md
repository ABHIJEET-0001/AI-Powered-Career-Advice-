# Python vs. R: The 2026 Verdict

If you are starting your journey in AI today, the most common question is: **"Should I learn Python or R?"**

## The Short Answer
For 90% of AI roles, **Python** is the winner.

## Why Python?
* **Deep Learning:** PyTorch and TensorFlow are Python-first.
* **Production:** It is much easier to deploy a Python model into a web app (like this one!).
* **Community:** The ecosystem is massive.

## When to use R?
R is still king in **Academia** and **pure Statistics**. If your goal is strictly data analysis for research papers (without building apps), R is powerful.

## Conclusion
Start with Python. Once you are comfortable, learning R is a nice bonus, but not strictly necessary for modern Machine Learning engineering.
