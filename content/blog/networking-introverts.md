# Networking for Introverts

If the idea of a "networking event" makes you want to hide, you are not alone. Many of the best engineers and researchers are introverts.

## 1. Quality over Quantity
You don't need 500 connections. You need 5 meaningful ones. Focus on deep conversations with one person rather than working the room.

## 2. Use the "Project" Strategy
Don't ask "What do you do?" Ask "What are you working on currently?"
This shifts the focus to the work, which is much easier for introverts to discuss passionately.

## 3. The Follow-up is Key
The real connection happens in the DMs or emails *after* the event. Send a note: "I really enjoyed hearing about X..."

## Summary
Networking isn't about being the loudest in the room. It's about being the most thoughtful.
