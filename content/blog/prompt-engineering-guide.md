# Master Prompt Engineering

AI is only as smart as the user guiding it. In 2026, "Prompt Engineering" is just "Communication Skills."

## The CO-STAR Framework
A popular method for perfect prompts:

* **C**ontext: Who is the AI? (e.g., "Act as a Senior Data Scientist")
* **O**bjective: What do you want?
* **S**tyle: Professional? Casual?
* **T**one: Empathetic? Direct?
* **A**udience: Who is reading this?
* **R**esponse Format: Table? Code? JSON?

## Example
**Bad:** "Write code for a snake game."
**Good:** "Act as a Python tutor. Write a beginner-friendly Snake game using Pygame. Comment every line to explain the logic to a 10-year-old student."

## Conclusion
Treat the AI like a junior intern. Be specific, give examples, and iterate.
