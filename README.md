<h2>�️ Project Migration</h2>

This project has recently undergone a major migration from vanilla HTML/JS to a robust React application.

### Why the Change?
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety, reducing bugs and improving developer experience compared to plain JavaScript.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Breaks down the monolithic interface into reusable components (`Navbar`, `Footer`, `ChatBot`, etc.).
- **Enhanced State Management**: Uses `AuthContext` for secure and efficient global state handling (User Auth, Course Enrollment).
- **Modern Tooling**: Leveraging **Vite** for lightning-fast development server start and optimized production builds.

### How to Run Locally

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
2. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
